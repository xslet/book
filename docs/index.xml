  <title>What is this?</title>
  <body>
   <p>
xslbook is an applet to display a book-style document on a Web browser with XSLT/CSS/Javascript technology.
   </p>
   <p>
This transforms XML documents into HTML documents with a built-in XSLT processor in a Web browser, and needs no other conversion tools.
If you use Firefox, Edge or IE, you can open local xslbook documents directly.
If you use Chrome or Safari, you need to open them via a Web server because Chrome and Safari forbid these local file access for their security policy.
   </p>
   <p>
You write only content in a XML file of a xslbook document. Layout and view style of a document is written in a XSL file and a CSS file.
This enables you to concentrate to determine chapter structure and write sentences of the document.
   </p>
   <p>
The layout and view style of a xslbook document can be changed as you like.
XSLT can extends a XSL file by importing to another XSL file with <code>xsl:import</code>, and CSS can also extends a CSS file by importing to another CSS file with <code>@import</code>.
You can customize appearance of a xslbook document by this way. Moreover, since xslbook provides the way to use multiple CSS files and Javascript files, you can create a document having rich functions.
xslbook has functions of chapter numbering, generating table of contents and page control by default.
   </p>
   <p>
The xslbook aims at a tool to create practical documents by only markup writing.
